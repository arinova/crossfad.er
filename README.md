# crossfad.er 

a simple youtube crossfader

## works

you can search for songs (or manually paste in a youtube video url), add them to your left or right queue, play/pause, skip songs, fade audio & video, view your queues, and click on a queued song to play it immediately, ahead of everything else

## to come

- save your set
- view & load sets saved by others
- possible integration with youtube accounts/playlists
- complete rewrite with better structure & design lol
- full-screen option for 2nd monitors / projectors

## inspo

there have been many great youtube crossfaders over the years, but most of them haven't kept up with changes to youtube's api & none of them, to my knowledge, have incorporated crossfading video in addition to audio
